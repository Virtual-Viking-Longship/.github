# The Virtual Viking Longship Project
### A Study in the Future of Liberal Arts Teaching and Research

This project explores and tests strategies for integrating undergraduate student learning and labor in the development of long-term Digital Humanities (DH) research projects. Combining the strengths of two leading liberal arts colleges with the multidisciplinary affordances of virtual reality (VR) technologies, the project aims to create an immersive VR experience for visualizing the social and cultural roles of a Viking Age longship by forming a DH community of inquiry and practice that cultivates deep competencies in spatial computing within the context of a liberal arts education. You can learn more about the project and view a walkthrough video of the prototype experience [here](https://youtu.be/SJ-tCGOemZU).
